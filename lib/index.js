/**
 * Per-provider request-body compression, pre-transmission, and timing for model
 * requests.
 *
 * Response compression is already on in Node: undici's `fetch` sends
 * `accept-encoding: gzip, deflate` by default and decompresses the reply, so
 * there is nothing to enable on that side. The switch that actually moves
 * bytes is the **request** direction: a long body is compressed — brotli by
 * default, gzip where brotli is unavailable or refused — and announced with the
 * matching `content-encoding`. On a real session that is 3.8 MB down to 1.46 MB,
 * and what matters beyond the ratio is that the fixed fields can then be
 * pre-transmitted, leaving a few hundred bytes for the request itself to write.
 *
 * The adapter seam offers no header hook — both shipped adapters call the
 * global `fetch` directly — so this plugin owns that seam: it patches
 * `globalThis.fetch` for the lifetime of its fiber and rewrites only requests
 * it can attribute to an enabled provider.
 *
 * Attribution comes from the `llm/stream` waterfall, wrapped in an
 * `AsyncLocalStorage` scope so the provider identity survives the adapter's
 * internal `await`s and cannot be confused by concurrent streams. When a
 * request arrives with no attribution (a hand-built call), the endpoint index
 * is used as a fallback.
 *
