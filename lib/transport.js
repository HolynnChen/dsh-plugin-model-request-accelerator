/**
 * HTTP/2 transport for model requests, with a fallback that cannot be worse than
 * not having it.
 *
 * Node's `globalThis.fetch` speaks HTTP/1.1 only. Its dispatcher is the built-in
 * undici's own `Agent`, which does not pass `allowH2` — and undici upgrades to
 * h2 only when that option is *explicitly* true — while the built-in Agent class
 * is not reachable from application code (`process.getBuiltinModule` does not
 * resolve node's internal undici, and the internal specifier is not a public
 * builtin). So there is no way to ask the built-in transport for h2.
 *
 * What does work is a *consistent pair*: dsh's own `undici` package, driving its
 * own `fetch` with its own `Agent({ allowH2: true })`. Mixing the two undici
 * instances in either direction does not: the bundled 7.x fetch rejects an 8.x
 * Agent's handler with `invalid onRequestStart method`. Hence the rule this
 * module exists to enforce — **both halves always come from the same module
 * instance**, and if only one is resolvable, h2 is simply off.
 *
 * Degradation is the protocol's own, not a retry state machine: h2 is reached
 * through ALPN, so an origin that does not offer it stays on http/1.1 inside the
 * same Agent, with no error and nothing to detect. What is left for this module
 * is the case ALPN cannot cover — a transport that fails outright, or an
 * `http://` origin, where h2 would need cleartext h2c — so an origin that has
 * failed once is remembered and never tried again for the life of the plugin.
